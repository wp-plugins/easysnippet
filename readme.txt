Test Rich Snippet markup on all pages and see Google's preview. For all rich snippet markup: recipes, reviews, products, people, music and more

== Description ==

Run all the pages on your blog through Google's [Rich Snippet Test Tool](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets) with a single click.

When Google implemented [Rich Snippets](http://support.google.com/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=99170) they
also provided a test tool so you can verify that a page is correctly formatted and see how Google will show your page in their search results.

That's great, but... if you need to check more than a few pages, it's a time consuming and tedious task.

EasySnippet makes it easy to check every page on your Wordpress blog with just one click.
